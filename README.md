Secure Cloud Environment on Azure with Terraform

Quick Description
This project provisions a structured, secure, and monitored Azure environment using Terraform.
It demonstrates Cloud Security best practices by combining network segmentation, a hardened bastion host, an isolated private VM, and a protected Key Vault.
The environment is integrated with Log Analytics and Azure Monitor, collecting logs, metrics, and generating alerts automatically.

1. Architecture Overview
Internet (your /32)
   â”‚  SSH (22) allowed only from your IP
   â–¼
[Bastion VM]  (public subnet 10.0.1.0/24, public IP)
   â”‚  SSH ProxyJump only
   â–¼
[Private VM] (private subnet 10.0.2.0/24, no public IP)
   â”‚  Managed Identity + VNet service endpoint (KeyVault)
   â–¼
[Azure Key Vault] (RBAC enabled, network ACL: only private subnet)


Security controls

Public NSG: Allow TCP/22 from my_ip_cidr only; deny everything else.

Private NSG: Allow TCP/22 only from the bastion subnet (10.0.1.0/24).

Key Vault: RBAC enabled, purge protection, soft delete, network ACL restricted to private subnet.

Private VM: Uses Managed Identity with roles Reader + Key Vault Secrets User.

3. Prerequisites

Active Azure subscription + az login

Terraform â‰¥ 1.6

Sufficient permissions: create RG, VNet, NSG, VM, Key Vault, RBAC role assignments

Your public IP address (my_ip_cidr)

4. Deployment
terraform init -upgrade
terraform fmt -recursive
terraform apply -auto-approve


Expected outputs:

bastion_public_ip
private_vm_ip
keyvault_name
keyvault_uri

5. Testing & Validation

The environment has been tested and validated with the following scenarios:

ðŸ”¹ Bastion Access
nc -vz $(terraform output -raw bastion_public_ip) 22
ssh -i .ssh/bastion_id_rsa azureuser@$(terraform output -raw bastion_public_ip)


ðŸ‘‰ Bastion is reachable only from your IP.

ðŸ”¹ Private VM via SSH Jump
ssh -o "ProxyCommand=ssh -i .ssh/bastion_id_rsa -W %h:%p azureuser@$(terraform output -raw bastion_public_ip)" \
    -i .ssh/private_vm_id_rsa \
    azureuser@$(terraform output -raw private_vm_ip)


ðŸ‘‰ Private VM has no public exposure; access only through bastion.

ðŸ”¹ Key Vault Access from Private VM
az login --identity
az keyvault secret show --vault-name $(terraform output -raw keyvault_name) \
  --name db-password --query value -o tsv


ðŸ‘‰ Secret is retrieved only from within the private subnet via Managed Identity.

ðŸ”¹ Monitoring & Alerts

Syslog events ingested from both VMs.

Azure Activity Logs streamed to Log Analytics.

Key Vault Audit Events visible.

CPU alerts automatically triggered above 80% usage for 5 minutes.

6. Monitoring & KQL Queries

All logs and metrics are centralized in the Log Analytics Workspace (LAW).
Below are ready-to-use KQL queries to validate and explore data.

ðŸ”¹ Syslog â€“ Authentication Events
Syslog
| where Facility in ("auth", "authpriv")
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| summarize count() by Computer, SeverityLevel, ProcessName

ðŸ”¹ Syslog â€“ Last 30 Minutes Summary
Syslog
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30m)
| summarize c = count() by Computer, Facility, SeverityLevel

ðŸ”¹ Azure Activity â€“ Subscription Operations
AzureActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| project TimeGenerated, ResourceGroup, ResourceProvider, OperationName, Caller, ActivityStatus
| order by TimeGenerated desc

ðŸ”¹ Key Vault â€“ Access Audit
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceType == "VAULTS"
| where Category == "AuditEvent"
| project TimeGenerated, OperationName, ResultDescription, Identity
| order by TimeGenerated desc

ðŸ”¹ VM CPU Utilization
InsightsMetrics
| where Namespace == "Processor"
| where Name == "UtilizationPercentage"
| summarize avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m), Computer
| order by TimeGenerated desc


How to run queries:

Go to Log Analytics Workspace â†’ Logs in Azure Portal.

Select your workspace (law-secureenv).

Copy/paste a query.

Adjust time range if needed (ago(1h), ago(24h), etc.).

ðŸ‘‰ Queries can be saved as Query Packs, transformed into custom alerts, or pinned into dashboards for visualization.

7. Security Measures

Network segmentation: strict separation between public/private.

Default-deny NSGs: only explicit flows allowed.

Just-in-time admin access: bastion limited to your /32.

Managed Identity: no secrets in code, access via RBAC.

Key Vault hardening: soft delete + purge protection.

Centralized monitoring: every critical component feeds into Log Analytics.

8. Operations & Cost Control

Update admin IP:

my_ip_cidr = "<NEW.IP>/32"
terraform apply -auto-approve


Lock down Key Vault after bootstrap:

network_acls { ip_rules = [] }


Destroy resources when done:

terraform destroy -auto-approve
